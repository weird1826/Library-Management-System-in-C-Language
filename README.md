### >> Issue/Borrowing Management
You (librarian) can issue a book to an individual by specifying the following information:
1. Book Name<br>
2. Borrower's Name<br>
3. Number of days the book is being borrowed<br>
4. Date of Issue<br>

- Only one book can be issued per entry.
- The Date of Issue is fetched automatically by the program.
- This borrower's information is stored in an issueHolderDBS.txt file.
- When the book is issued, 1 is deducted from the amount of its stock in the bookInfo.txt file.

**Additional Features in Borrow Management**<br>
Before issuing a book, the program will check whether the book actually exists or not. If it exists, it will then check whether the book is in sufficient stock. I've set a limit, that if a book's stock is <=20 then the program will not allow the librarian to issue the book.

### >> View complete borrower's database
You can view the whole borrower's database by (unfiltered and unsorted) by just selecting the <code>View Aquirer Database</code> option

### >> Returning of the borrowed book by a reader
When a borrower returns a book, the book can be added back to the shelf by specifying the following information:
1. Borrower's Name
2. Book Name

- The program will check the issueHolderDBS.txt for such entry, and if it exists, it will proceed to delete that entry by file swapping and rewriting methods.
